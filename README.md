# Network_Threat_Analysis

This project was made as a part of my Big Data Analytics course.

Analysis and prediction of network traffic has several applications and has recently
garnered a substantial number of research. Experiments of various types are carried
out and analyzed in order to discover various flaws in existing computer network
applications. The study and forecast of network traffic is a proactive strategy to
ensuring safe, reliable, and quality network communication. Various strategies for
evaluating network traffic are developed and tested, ranging from neural network-
based techniques to data mining techniques. Similarly, many linear and non-linear
models for network traffic prediction are offered. Several intriguing combinations
of network analysis and prediction approaches are used to get efficient and effective
outcomes.
